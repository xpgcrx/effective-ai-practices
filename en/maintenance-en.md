### Split Memory Files

Writing everything in a single memory file leads to difficulties in management and context pressure.
Therefore, it is effective to split memory files by topic.

Example:

- Describe general matters in `GEMINI.md`
- For code review perspectives, extract them to `code-review.md` and mention in `GEMINI.md` to refer to it during code review.
